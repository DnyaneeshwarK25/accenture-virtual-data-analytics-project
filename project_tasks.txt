# Accenture Virtual Project Tasks

1. Data Cleaning
- Remove rows with missing values.
- Change data types of values in specific columns as needed.
- Drop irrelevant columns (those not useful to the business problem).
- Final output: three cleaned datasets.

2. Presentation Preparation (Slides 2-6)
- Download the Accenture presentation template.
- Populate the following slides:
  • Slide 2: Agenda - Topics covered in the presentation.
  • Slide 3: Project Recap - Key points from the project brief.
  • Slide 4: Problem - The business problem being addressed.
  • Slide 5: The Analytics Team - Include Andrew Fleming, Marcus Rompton, and yourself.
  • Slide 6: Process - Outline steps taken for the analysis.

3. Record Your Video
- Create a 10-minute maximum presentation video.
- Ensure it is clear, engaging, and tells a compelling story.
- Focus on eye contact and delivery, as slides won't be visible in the video.
